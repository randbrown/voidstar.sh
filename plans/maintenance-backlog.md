# Maintenance backlog — refactors, perf wins, tech debt

A living, prioritized record of code-health findings from a full-codebase review (2026-06). These
are **identified, not yet done** — pick from here when you have cleanup budget. Nothing here is a
correctness emergency; the instrument works. Items are grouped and roughly ordered by leverage.

Companion reading: [`../docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md) (perf budgets),
[`../docs/audio-engine.md`](../docs/audio-engine.md), [`../docs/looper-and-sequencer.md`](../docs/looper-and-sequencer.md),
[`../docs/livecoding.md`](../docs/livecoding.md), [`../docs/entanglement.md`](../docs/entanglement.md).

---

## A. Structural refactors (highest leverage)

1. **Split `page-init.js` (~5,100 lines).** The entire imperative integration layer is one file.
   Extract, in rough order of independence: the fx registration list; the export/import
   `.qualem.zip` bundle (`exportBundle`/`importBundle`); the DOIO keymap + MIDI handlers (already
   spec'd in `docs/doio-kb16-qualia-keymap.md`); per-panel wiring. `core.js` is already cleanly
   injectable — this is pure mechanical decomposition.
2. **Harden + decompose `strudel-hydra.js` (~1,636 lines).**
   - ✅ **Pin the Strudel CDN version** — *done:* pinned to `@1.3.0` (was `@latest`) via a
     `STRUDEL_VERSION` const with a bump note.
   - Add a real `dispose()`: the global `AudioNode.connect` patch, two ResizeObservers, two
     intervals, window/document listeners, and audio nodes all leak.
   - Split into transport / audio-tap / cycle-clock / editor-settings / pattern-API.
3. **Shed UI from the large audio files:** `looper.js` (~2,765), `vocoder.js` (~1,557),
   `sequencer.js`. Each mixes engine + DOM; extract the panel UI (and the shared drag block, B2).
4. **Split `overlay.js` (~803 lines)** into pose-visuals / ripples / post-process (ASCII, mosh,
   edge) — three independent units.

## B. Cross-cutting duplication → shared utilities

1. ✅ **`prefs.js` (`getRaw`/`setRaw`/`getBool`/`setBool`/`getNum`/`getJSON`/`setJSON`/`clamp01`).**
   *Done:* added the module and migrated `sequencer.js`, `sequencer-patterns.js`, `patterns.js`
   (behavior-preserving — same keys, defaults, and post-parse validation) and pointed `looper.js`'s
   `lsGet`/`lsSet`/`clamp01` at it. Remaining inline localStorage lives in `looper.js`'s larger
   config blob and `strudel-hydra.js`/`vocoder.js` panel state — migrate opportunistically.
2. ✅ **`makeDraggablePanel(id, panel)`.** *Done:* the verbatim drag/reposition/ResizeObserver
   block (~70 lines × 4) now lives in `panel-pos.js`; `mixer.js`, `sequencer.js`, `vocoder.js`, and
   `strudel-hydra.js` each call `makeDraggablePanel('<id>', panel)` (grip derived as `${id}-header`,
   returns `reposition` for their `open()`). **Needs a smoke test** (UI, not build-checkable): open
   each panel, drag it by the header, confirm it moves and clamps to the viewport, resize via the
   corner, reload → position persists, and each panel still tucks under the topbar on open.
   *Remaining:* `entangle-ui.js` and `looper.js`/`page-init.js` have their own drag variants — fold
   in opportunistically if they match.
3. **`fx-helpers.js`.** `ema`/`damp`/`decay`, idle-spectrum sine fallback, fade-fill,
   smoothed-pose-target, `hslToRgb`, `drawFullscreen` (webgl) are reinvented across nearly every fx
   (~6 hand-rolled EMA variants). Centralizing also kills per-fx allocation drift.
4. **Reuse `limiter.js` in the vocoder** (it reimplements `makeLimiter`/`setLimiterEngaged` with a
   −1.5 dB ceiling) — parameterize the ceiling.
5. ✅ **Move the `getUserMedia` ladder into `devices.js`** — *done:* `openMicStream(deviceId, base)`
   holds the try-exact-then-default fallback ladder; `audio.js` and `vocoder.js` each keep their own
   `MIC_CONSTRAINTS` (stereo vs low-latency hint) and pass it in. **Needs a mic smoke test:** mic
   input still drives visuals/monitor (audio.js) and the vocoder still captures; switching the mic
   picker to a now-unplugged device falls back to default rather than erroring.
6. **Array-based disposal** for `rig-strip.js` and `vocoder.js` — both hand-list ~40 nodes in
   teardown (drift risk). Push nodes into an array at creation; iterate on dispose.
7. ✅ **Share the cycle-pool / phase-pool predicate** — *done:* `isStepInPhase` now delegates to
   `isInCycle`; both pool files + `panel-pos.js` also moved their raw localStorage onto `prefs.js`.
8. **Unify the audio-uniform upload** shape (`webgl.js` vs `three-host.js`).

## C. Realtime performance wins (ranked)

0. ✅ **Rig monitoring latency** — *done:* the fixed graph delay on the live path is gone.
   Drive shapers oversample `'4x'` only while ON (bypass = `'none'`; the resamplers cost ~4 ms
   group delay per shaper), the strip comp HARD-bypasses (rewired around under a ~6 ms gain dip —
   Chromium's `DynamicsCompressor` keeps its ~6 ms lookahead even when "transparent"), and the rig
   master limiter is now a zero-latency soft-clip `WaveShaper` (`makeSoftLimiter`) instead of the
   compressor brickwall. The strip subhead shows a live latency readout
   (`looper-audio.getLatencyInfo()`: output latency + enabled-stage delay + mic/output
   sample-rate-mismatch warning), and enabling earth/metal/comp pops a transient "+~N ms" note.
   *Note:* the LSTM/WASM item below is a **throughput** lever, not a latency one — the LSTM is
   causal and adds no delay.
1. **Neural amp LSTM worklet (`worklets/neural-amp.js`)** — hottest loop in the app (O(4·H²)
   mul-adds + 4 `exp`/`tanh` per hidden unit per sample). tanh/sigmoid **lookup table** (or the
   tanh-based sigmoid identity to share one call); a WASM/SIMD backend is the bigger lever; add
   **denormal flushing** for silent-decay state.
2. **Waveshaper curve churn on knob drags** — rig Earth/Metal and vocoder gate/de-ess rebuild
   1–2K-float arrays on every slider tick. Quantize/cache by amount, rebuild on epsilon change.
3. ✅ **`pinkNoiseBuffer` generated 2× per vocoder build** — *done:* memoized per (ctx, seconds).
4. ✅ **`pitch.js` allocates a `Float32Array` per call**, called per frame — *done:* hoisted to a
   reused module scratch (guard cells zeroed to preserve fresh-alloc semantics).
5. ✅ **`field.js scaleAudio` allocates a nested frame object** every frame for every fx with
   reactivity ≠ 1 — *done:* writes into a reused module scratch.
6. **Per-frame canvas2d gradients** — `overlay.js` creates a linear gradient *per bone per person*;
   `neural-field.js` a radial gradient *per soma*. Cache by quantized hue.
7. ✅ **`sequencer.js` audio callback uses `for…of`** (iterator alloc per tick on the audio thread)
   — *done:* indexed loop.
8. **`chladni.js evalField` returns 3-tuple arrays per particle** (~6,000 allocs/frame) + a
   `createImageData` every frame in field mode — return via out-params, reuse the ImageData.
9. **Strudel editor "perf mode" default-on** in performance contexts (disable per-frame pattern
   highlighting) — the biggest single main-thread lever during a set.
10. **Fix/clarify `strudel.perFrame` wired to `core.onFps` (~5 Hz)** — Hydra `a.fft` visuals update
    at ~5 fps despite the name. Rename or rewire.
11. **`mp4-timecode.addTimecodeTrack` full second copy** of a multi-GB file via `concat` — pass
    subarray views to `new Blob([...])`. (Auto-save already skips this pass.)
12. **`recMixCtx` (recordable-mix AudioContext) is never closed** — persistent extra audio graph
    after the first recording; notable on mobile. Close on recorder teardown.
13. **Pose:** downscale the source before `createImageBitmap` (landmarks don't need 1920px) to cut
    copy + inference cost, especially on phones.
14. **Looper record** keeps every 128-frame quantum as a separate array then concatenates — pre-grow
    a single buffer (the live-view ring already does this).
15. **Overlay sparks** loop iterates the full 2,400-slot ring every frame regardless of live count —
    track a live-count cursor.

## D. Correctness / robustness

1. **Entangle Worker/DO has no validation, rate-limiting, size-cap, or auth** — bandwidth flood +
   `role`/`target` spoof are possible. Add a per-socket token bucket, message-size cap, drop unknown
   topics. (Low-stakes for an intimate set; do before any public deployment.)
2. ✅ **Delete or honestly relabel `entangle-transport.js`** — *done (relabeled):* banner on the
   file + corrected the `entangle.js` comment so it's marked research-only, not a drop-in fallback.
3. **Smooth direct audience param control** — add a per-param slew so phone-driven sliders don't
   step on the projection.
4. **Add `dispose()` paths** where missing: `strudel-hydra.js` (worst), `sequencer.js`,
   `entangle-ui.js` (intervals + perpetual skeleton rAF), and terminate the **pose worker** on
   `stopCamera`.
5. ✅ **`entangle.js`** — *done:* `modes.skeleton` now initialized to `false` explicitly.
6. **`looper-audio.js stopRecording`** uses `setTimeout` to wait for the OUT boundary — fragile
   under tab-throttling; the worklet has sample-accurate timing it could use.
7. **Port mind's Drive token-lifecycle fixes to setlist + qualia (P2).** The mind sync automation
   pass (2026-07) established ground truth: GIS `requestAccessToken({prompt:'none'})` is **always a
   popup** (no iframe path in the token client), so a gestureless "silent renew" is popup-blocked in
   most browsers — and capturing one ~1h token at client init 401s forever in long sessions.
   Setlist ported the renewal machinery (single-flight + throttles + `armGestureRenewal`, 2026-07-13);
   `qualia/gdrive.js` still does none of it (its docs repeat the hidden-iframe claim). Still to port
   to BOTH from mind's 2026-07-14 pass: the stored **account `hint`** on every token request (a
   multi-account profile fails every `prompt:'none'` renewal with `account_selection_required`
   without it) and the **denial latch** (`_renewDeniedAt` — when Google answers
   `interaction_required` & co., stop timer retries for 60 min instead of flashing a doomed popup
   every 5 min on the installed desktop app). Mind's fix also supersedes setlist finding G3
   (reconnect visibility) as the model to copy.
8. **mind: `changes.list` freshness peek (P3).** The scheduler heartbeat peeks via three
   `files.list` calls; Drive's `changes.list` with a persisted `startPageToken` (supported under
   `drive.file`; the cursor never expires) would make it one cheap request and detect attachment
   binaries too. Quota is a non-issue at current cadence (~2-7 req/min/device vs 12k/min/user) —
   do it if the cadence ever tightens or the corpus grows shards. A `changes.watch` webhook +
   Web Push relay (true realtime pings + closed-app wake on Android) would need a small Worker
   (patterned on `workers/setlist-sync` + `workers/entangle-signal`); park until polling feels slow.

## E. Documentation drifts (most fixed in this pass — keep them fixed)

- `agent-reference.md` said "GitLab Pages" → it's **Cloudflare Pages**. *(fixed)*
- `/lab/qualia` is a redirect to `/qualia`; AGENTS.md / THEMES.md / fx-contract README referenced
  the old path. *(fixed)*
- `lab.astro` card + `qualia-plan.md` said "3 reference fx" → there are **22 + arcade**.
  *(lab.astro fixed; plan files carry a historical-doc banner)*
- `qualia-plan.md` "no Three.js" is reversed → Three.js is a dependency. *(banner added)*
- `src/lib/qualia/README.md` (fx contract) predated `types.js`: missing `'three'` context, `text`/
  `file` param types, `autoPhase`, `maxDpr`, `crowd.*` channels. *(fixed)*
- `_synthwave.md` said "not yet implemented" → `synthwave.js` ships. *(banner added)*
- Root `README.md` was the Astro starter boilerplate. *(rewritten)*
- GitHub handle drift: `lab.astro` linked `github.com/voidstar` vs `randbrown` elsewhere. *(fixed)*

## F. Easy value-adds (low cost, existing infra)

- **`ParamText`/`ParamFile` already exist** in `types.js` — synthwave's deferred custom text and any
  title/label/cue text is now trivial.
- **MIDI-learn for any param** — the MIDI CC path + the modulation channel registry already exist;
  generalize beyond the three hard-coded CCs.
- **Recorder chapter markers** — a SMPTE timecode track is already written; add a hotkey to drop
  named markers for post.
- **Visual metronome / click** bound to `cps` (the tuner + cps clock already exist).
- ✅ **Scene crossfade** between scenes — *done:* `core.beginTransition({style, durationMs})`
  freezes the outgoing viz canvas in a screen-blended layer and dissolves/wipes it out as
  the incoming scene renders underneath. Wired into every scene change (auto-phase steps,
  auto-cycle swaps, manual quale switch / V / swipe, qualem recall). Global `transition-style`
  (cut / dissolve / wipe) + `transition-ms` controls in the topbar `auto` popover, persisted in
  settings; also composited into recordings.
- **Shared offscreen-canvas pool** for the overlay post-FX (each currently keeps its own).
- **Icon-shaped overlay sparks (Iconism tie-in, 2026-07).** The Iconism quale
  (`fx/iconism.js`) renders the Emmons fret-marker atoms and Sho-Bud card suits as its own
  scene, but the original ask included icons riding **on top of other quales** — and the
  overlay already composites above every fx at z:3, with beat-driven sparks emitted from pose
  joints (`overlay.js` `emitSpark`/`drawSparks`, the `F` toggle). Plan:
  1. Extract Iconism's one-time sprite bakes (`bakeAtom`/`bakeSuit`, the Emmons/Sho-Bud
     palettes, the suit `Path2D` construction) into a shared module (e.g. `icon-sprites.js`)
     consumed by both `fx/iconism.js` and `overlay.js`.
  2. Add a `spark style` select to the overlay: `dots` (today's `arc()` renderer) | `emmons` |
     `shobud`. For sprite styles, blit the baked sprite (rotate + scale per spark) instead of
     the arc, colored from the icon palettes rather than the person-palette hue.
  3. Sparks live in parallel `Float32Array`s — add `sang`/`sspin` arrays (angle, spin) filled
     at emit time; zero cost for the `dots` style.
  4. Icons want *dozens on screen, not thousands*: when a sprite style is active, cut the
     emission rates hard (≈ 1/20), raise per-spark size, and lengthen life so the shapes read.
     `MAX_SPARKS` (2400) stays — the pool is shared and mostly idle in sprite mode.
  This gets "atoms/suits over any quale" with no new canvas, no second fx layer, and no
  per-frame allocation — the sprite blit path is exactly what Iconism already ships.
- ✅ **Apps-review value-adds (2026-07):** `audio.pitch`/`audio.pitchClass`/`audio.pitchConf`
  modulation channels (rig-tuner pitch → any knob; hue-by-note); per-quale fps badge in the fx
  picker; **cycle-quantized scene changes** (`♩ cycle` in the auto popover — quale/phase changes
  land on the Strudel downbeat); **projector/OBS output window** (⧉ in the capture group,
  captureStream of the clean composite); loop-seam crossfades; **freeze/infinite-sustain pedal**
  (`frz` / `;`). See `docs/looper-and-sequencer.md` + `docs/architecture.md`.

## G. Setlist app (`/lab/setlist`) — review findings (2026-07)

From a focused review of the setlist lab + its worker. The backup-merge hardening from the same
pass (auto-push now pull-merges, duplicate data files heal, sources/settings merge fill-empty,
key parses from chart text) is already **done** — these are the items still open:

1. **Escape interpolations in `views.js` templates (security, P1).** Song titles/artists/notes are
   interpolated into `innerHTML` across the views, and those fields are populated from external
   sources (Spotify track names, Drive filenames, web-search results). A hostile name is stored
   XSS, and localStorage holds Drive + Spotify tokens. The pickers already use `textContent`
   deliberately; the persisted fields need the same treatment — add an `esc()` helper (or DOM
   builders) at every `${}` that can carry non-local data.
2. **Worker has no auth (security/cost, P1).** CORS is not access control: anyone who learns the
   worker URL can call `/ai/chart` (burns `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` per call),
   `/spotify/search-batch` (100 searches/call), and the Drive/search routes (API-key quota).
   Add a `WORKER_TOKEN` secret checked on every route, stored client-side in sources (which now
   rides the Drive backup) and sent as a header. Also: `/ai/chart` sets `Cache-Control` but worker
   responses aren't edge-cached automatically — use the Cache API so repeat calls are free.
3. **Reconnect visibility (P2).** The GIS token lives ~1 h and can't refresh without a gesture; the
   "↻ reconnect" pill only exists on the dashboard, so edits made elsewhere silently stay
   local-only until the next visit to #home. Surface the reconnect state on the song/setlist pages
   (the `syncNowButton` status line is the natural spot).
4. **Merge granularity (P3).** Backup merge is last-write-wins per whole record; simultaneous edits
   to *different fields* of the same song on two devices lose one side. Acceptable single-user, but
   `statuses` could union cheaply if it ever bites.
5. **Direct-linked PDF charts cache but don't render (P3).** `isDirectFile` accepts `.pdf` and the
   cache stores the PDF blob, but the render path puts it in an `<img>`. Route Drive-id PDFs exist
   (thumbnail rasterize); direct PDF URLs should either be rejected from cache or rendered via
   object/iframe.
6. **Settings UX (P3).** "restore from drive" and "back up now" run the identical merge cycle —
   keep one and label it honestly ("back up & pull now"). The dashboard button "sources" opens a
   page titled "sources & auto-link" that also holds backup/Spotify/offline — rename to
   "settings" and move Drive backup to the top. (✅ "scrape" is now "read chart".)
7. **Dead code (P3).** `store.getNotesForSongBulk` is unused (and ignores its argument);
   `sources.driveCharts` has a default + sync path but no Settings UI writes it.
8. **Perf nits (P3).** `renderSetlistView`/`renderPerformMode` `await store.getSong()` per song in
   a loop (fine ≤50 songs, `Promise.all` when it itches); worker `search-batch` searches
   sequentially.
9. ✅ **Value-adds** — *done (2026-07):* LRCLIB lyrics (`lyrics.js`, synced lines follow the
   timecode timer), scanned-chart vision read (worker `POST /ai/chart-read`, wired into the song
   page's "read chart" button), and iTunes metadata in `/meta/song`
   (artist/genre/year/artwork/duration, applied by the "fetch info" button). Still open:
   MusicBrainz as a second canonical-artist source if iTunes misses.
10. ✅ **Value-adds, second pass** — *done (2026-07, apps-review follow-up):* deletion
   tombstones + authoritative restore + **Trash view** (`#trash`); perform-mode **set timer /
   pacing HUD** (elapsed vs summed `durationSec`, amber when over); worker `WORKER_TOKEN` gate +
   per-IP throttle; the `views.js` esc() sweep (G1) and reconnect false-positive fix.
11. **Capo-aware chord display** (deliberate FUTURE DEV, deferred by choice 2026-07): render the
   "played shape" chord names for a given capo alongside the Nashville numbers, so a guitarist
   reads shapes at a glance. `song.capo` is already in the model (chart-doc headers and
   "read chart" write it; no edit UI since the form slimmed to key + key changes). Would need:
   a capo edit affordance again, a number→shape mapping per key/capo, and a display toggle on
   the song page + perform mode. Parked, not rejected — revisit when a real charts-with-capo
   set makes it concrete.
